WELCOME TO LAB4!

Refer to the main.c file for instructions on what needs to be implemented. In addition, you will be writing some unit-tests of your own to verify the correctness of your implementation (and get some practice with test development).


You need to complete both Part A and Part B.

To build:
- cd into PartA or Part B
- run make
- Execute the resulting executable

Auto-grader:

Your submission will run through an "auto-grader" when pushing to GitHub. We will be checking to make sure your tests all pass and are free of critical memory errors. This is accomplished by using a tool called memcheck - part of Valgrind (https://valgrind.org/). You are free to push as many times as you like, as long as you do not force-push.
